#### Things I learned
<p>
  Some things that I learned was how different parts of the computer work. It was interresting to find that mostly all the computer
parts connect to the motherboard, and that the motherbaord is atually the central unit for all the processing that happens in a computer
and other devices. It was also interresting to learn about number systems, and I found that the systems of numbers that computer use to
complete and perform commands is very different than the regular systems and ways we use our numbers. It was also interresting to find 
out how the different types of number systems work with different things in the computer, for example how ASCII is used for recording 
typewrite, as well as how it is sent to other devices. I also learned a lot about how binary is used moslty in all parts of the computer 
since it is the most efficient as fastest way for the computer to read commands and act on them.

#### Things I want to learn
<p>
I would like to continue to learn about binary and other number systems that the computer uses since I find it very interresting how although
it amy seem incorrect how the computer interprets numbers, it is actually correct. Understanding this would allow me to become more adept with
programming since it would give me mmore knowledge of exactly what a computer expects when given commands. I also find it generally interresting
how the different parts of a computer work together, so maybe learning exactly how the information and circuits of a computer work together
would also be something I would be interrested in learning.
